# Instagram Logo
The focus of this project is to use pure CSS to create Instagram Logo.

---
## Something new that I learnt while building this project are:
- Pseudo classes (::before and ::after)
- The position property and its values:relative,absolute,fixed,static and sticky
- Box-shadow property
- Transform property 
- Box-sizing property

## The Outcome:
